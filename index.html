		<h1> How America's most controversial President uses Twitter </h1>

			<p>	Donald Trump is perhaps America's most controversial President. 
				When talking about Trump, it would be lacking to not mention 
				his notorious Twitter. Trump is known for not shying away from 
				using Twitter to express his personal opinions. Trump's tweets, 
				many times that made the front page headlines or broke the Internet,
				were considered even more official and viral compared to
				the White House's statements. However, looking at some of Trump's tweets, 
				I found some interesting inconsistencies in the ways he talks - or rather, 
				tweets. Sometimes his Tweets appear very personal and subjective. 
				Here is an example: </p>
				
				<img src="trump insult.png" alt="Trump's Tweet">

			<p> Other times, his tweets appear quite neutral and objective, almost as
			if they were written by someone else: </p>

			<img src="trump tweet.png" alt="Trump's Tweet">

			<p> This got me wondering: <em>Did Trump write all his tweets? Or could it
				be someone else? Is there a way to know? </em> It is quite common 
				for politicians to have staff responsible for social media 
				communication, so perhaps Trump was not an exception. 

				With data science, I was able to find the answer to the above questions. 
				<h5>There were indeed staff and Trump himself who have access to the same 
				Twitter @realDonaldTrump.</h5> How did I figure it out?
			 	Let's take a look at the process. </p>

			<p> I needed an extensive of Trump's twitter data, and fortunately
				<a href="https://www.thetrumparchive.com/"> The Trump Archive</a> 
				contains all the information I needed. I processed my data via Excel. 
				The extensive dataset contains all Trump's tweets since 2012, 
				their unique IDs, contents, time and date of posting, and 
				interestingly, the devices they were posted from originally. 
				To narrow down on unnecessary data, I filtered out retweets, 
				posting that are outside of Trump's presidency (2016-2021), and 
				those with little values (less than 30 favorites). As it turns out, 
				Trump posted his Tweets from multiple devices over the course
				of his presidency. I visualized the frequency of devices used over years
				during Trump's administration. </p>
			
			<div id='myDiv1'></div>
			<p> Android and iPhone tweets were most common, and after 2017 iPhone became
				the main device. Looking closer at the time and date of the tweets, 
				especially during 2016-2017, it appears that tweets were posted from both 
				devices on many overlapping days, at different times and different frequencies.
			</p>	
			<div id='myDiv'></div>
			
			<p> Is it possible that Android and iPhone users are different people?
				Another analysis into tweets' contents can confirm this. I looked into
				the content differences in the iPhone and Android tweets. Most of the iPhone
				tweets appear to be like announcements, with lots of hastags and image links:
				
				<div id='quotes'>
					<h5>Just landed in North Carolina- heading to the J.S. Dorton Arena. See you all soon! 
						Lets #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/EUo0keWX1Y</h5>
						— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
						November 7, 2016
				</div>

			<p> While most of the Android tend to express personal statements:</p>

				<div id='quotes'>
					<h5>Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head 
						of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?</h5>
						— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
						November 19, 2016
				</div>	
			<p> I sorted the data to see how often the iPhone/Android tweets
				contain image links and hastags. I flitered tweets that contains
				either "https" links or hastags, and then sorted them accordingly to
				iPhone/Android devices. With the results collected, I created 
				this bar graph via inforgram.  </p>

				<script id="infogram_0_30f37398-02e9-47df-abdb-da63fe69da5a" 
				title="Untitled slide project" src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?p6D" 
				type="text/javascript"></script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/30f37398-02e9-47df-abdb-da63fe69da5a" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" 
					target="_blank"></a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" 
					style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" 
					rel="nofollow"></a></div>

			<p> As demonstrated by the visualization, iPhone tweets contain a lot
				more hastags and link redirects, and have more official, announcement-like
				contents. Meanwhile, the Android ones appear to have mostly just personal statements,
				with simple, informal language. </p>		

			<p> Another way to prove the hypothesis is to compare the language and emotions behind the text.
				I conducted a sentiment analysis - the interpretation 
				and classification of human emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text 
				data. Using TextBlob, a Python library for sentiment analysis, I ran the Twitter's
				contents as data inputs and was able to get some sentiment figures. The algorithm is 
				not absolutely accurate, but it gives an idea of the emotions portrayed behind the tweets. 
				The polarity scale goes from -1 being negative, 0 means neutral and 1 being positive sentiments. 
				The subjectivity scale goes from -1 meaning very subjective to 1 being very objective. 
			</p>

			<p>Below are the comparison of the iPhone versus Android sentiment visualizations. </p>
		
				<div id='myDiv2'style: height=100vh></div>
				<div id='myDiv3'></div>

			<p>It appears that tweets from Android devices are more negatively-skewed, while the 
				iPhone tweets seem to be more neutral towards positive. The above sentiment analysis,
				combined with the tweeting frequency, indicates that Android and iPhone tweets
				are clearly from different people. This confirms our findings: The Android tweets 
				are most likely written by Donald Trump himself, while iPhone tweets are likely 
				to be written by staff for political campaigns or agenda purposes. </p>

			<p> What about tweets after 2017, when the Android phone is no longer used?
				How can we tell whether Trump or his staff wrote the Tweet? It is possible 
				to tell the tweets' authors by comparing the similarity in language of Trump's Android 
				tweets versus post-2017 iPhone tweets. Unfortunately, this is beyond my programming 
				skills. Luckily there are intelligent algorithms 
				that are particularly trained for this purpose, such as:</p>

					<iframe src="http://didtrumptweetit.com/" width="100%" height="300" style="border:none;">
					</iframe>
			</div>
			<p> Intelligent algorithms as above look into factors such as: language, 
					connotation, use of links/hastags, writing style, frequent words, and sentiments to decide
					how similar the Tweets are. The algorithms works by comparing the similarities among
					the tweets. The more they belong into a cluster, the higher the likelihood
					that they share the same author. After all, people can 
					change their devices, but the way they tweet and communicate 
					to the public stays the same. </p>
